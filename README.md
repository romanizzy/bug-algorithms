Bug Algorithms in Webots

Consist of Bug 0 and Bug 1 which are working programs written similarily.
A world will need to be built using the E-Puck robot in webots. 
Both may need to be adjusted to fit your webot build and system, however the logic is working.

Bug 2 is in the process in being revised. This bug algorithm is nearly complete, however 
you can still take this verison and make it your own.

If you are unfamiliar with webots, I suggest these videos to help you understand the world building process. https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbEU0vp_OQkUwANRMUOM00SXybYQ4TXNF&si=ejOqIpJbeA-LQ5_N
